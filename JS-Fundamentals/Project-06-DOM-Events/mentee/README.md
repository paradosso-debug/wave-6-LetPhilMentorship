# Project 06 — DOM & Events

## 🌱 Overview

The DOM (Document Object Model) is how JavaScript _talks to the page_. You’ll learn to **select elements**, **read/write content**, **style via classes**, **create/remove nodes**, and **listen for user events**.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Select elements using `querySelector` / `querySelectorAll`.
- Read and write text with `textContent`/`innerText` and attributes with `getAttribute`/`setAttribute`.
- Style elements by changing `style` and toggling CSS classes.
- Create, append, and remove elements dynamically.
- Attach event listeners for clicks, inputs, and keyboard events.

## 🌍 Real-Life Relevance

| Concept             | Everyday Analogy                      | Real-World Example                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Selecting elements  | Pointing to a specific item in a room | Grab the “Add to Cart” button to wire it up |
| Writing text        | Updating a label                      | Show “3 items in cart” after add/remove     |
| Styling & classes   | Switching outfits                     | Dark mode toggle adds/removes a class       |
| Creating & removing | Adding/removing sticky notes          | Show search results, then clear them        |
| Events              | Reacting to taps/clicks               | Submit a form, play/pause, open/close menus |

> Tip: Open these in a small demo HTML file to run them, or paste into DevTools Console after creating simple elements.
