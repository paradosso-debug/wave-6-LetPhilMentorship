# Project 07 — Array Methods (map, filter, reduce, find, some/every)

## 🌱 Overview
Modern JavaScript relies heavily on **array methods** to transform, filter, search, and summarize data. These tools make your code shorter, clearer, and more powerful than manual loops.

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Transform arrays with **`.map()`**.
- Keep only what you need using **`.filter()`**.
- Combine all values into one using **`.reduce()`**.
- Locate items with **`.find()` / `.findIndex()`**.
- Check conditions with **`.some()` / `.every()`**.

## 🌍 Real-Life Relevance
| Method | Everyday Analogy | Real-World Example |
|---|---|---|
| map | Translate each word | Format product prices for display |
| filter | Sift beans from stones | Show only in‑stock or under budget |
| reduce | Add receipts into a total | Cart subtotal, average ratings |
| find / findIndex | Look for a specific key | Locate a user by email, get its position |
| some / every | Quick checks | “Any overdue?” / “Are all tasks done?” |

## 📁 What’s Inside
Each topic file contains **5 mini-examples (EX1–EX5)** to practice:

1. `01-map.js`  
2. `02-filter.js`  
3. `03-reduce.js`  
4. `04-find-and-findIndex.js`  
5. `05-some-and-every.js`  

## ✅ Checklist
- [ ] I can explain when to use map vs filter vs reduce.  
- [ ] I can find a single matching item or its index.  
- [ ] I can check if **any** or **all** items match a condition.  
- [ ] I can chain methods for concise, readable data pipelines.
