## 🎯 Goal

Build a small web page that shows a **Daily Study Summary**.

You’ll practice:

- Declaring and reassigning variables (`let`, `const`)
- Working with strings, numbers, and booleans
- Using `typeof`
- Creating a summary message with **template literals**
- Showing that summary **on the page** with JavaScript + DOM

---

## 🧠 What the Page Does

- Has a **title** and a short description.
- Has a **“Generate Summary”** button.
- When the button is clicked:
  - JavaScript creates / updates variables about the student.
  - Builds a multi-line summary with a template literal.
  - Shows the text inside the `<pre>` on the page.
  - Logs the `typeof` for the key variables in the console.
