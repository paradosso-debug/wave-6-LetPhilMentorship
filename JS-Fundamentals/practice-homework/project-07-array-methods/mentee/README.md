# 💸 Budget Flow — DOM + Array Methods Expense Tracker 

You’re building a modern “Budget Flow” dashboard that tracks a **saved starting budget (income number)** and your **expenses**.

Key detail:
- The budget is **saved** (state + localStorage)
- The budget input **clears after saving** so it doesn’t “chase” the overview

---



## Array Methods You’ll Practice 
- `map()` — transform expenses into numeric arrays / display pieces
- `filter()` — search + category filter
- `reduce()` — totals + category sums + averages
- `find()` — first expense above the average expense
- `findIndex()` — index of the first expense above the average
- `some()` — check if balance is negative
- `every()` — sanity check that all amounts are positive

---

## How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Type a starting budget and click **Save budget**
3. Add expenses
4. Try search/filters/sort and watch the overview update live
