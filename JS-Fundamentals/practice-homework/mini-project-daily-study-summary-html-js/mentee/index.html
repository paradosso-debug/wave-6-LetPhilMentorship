    <!-- Goal  
  Build a small web page where clicking a button triggers JavaScript
  to create variables, update them, and display a formatted study summary.

Exact element ids required  
  generate-summary-btn, summary-output

STEP 1 — Page Title  
  Add a main heading so the user immediately knows what the project is about.  
  This heading should clearly say Daily Study Summary.

STEP 2 — Description  
  Add a short paragraph explaining what will happen when the button is clicked.  
  This tells the user that the JS code will generate and display the summary.

STEP 3 — Action Button  
  Add a button with the exact id generate-summary-btn.  
  This is the element your JavaScript will attach a click event listener to.  
  When the user clicks it, your JS will run your summary-generating function.

STEP 4 — Output Label  
  Add a smaller heading above the area where the summary will appear.  
  This helps the user understand that the section below will show the results.

STEP 5 — Output Area  
  Add an element with the exact id summary-output.  
  Use a <pre> element so the template-literal formatting (line breaks, spacing)
  appears exactly as written when JavaScript inserts the summary with .textContent.

STEP 6 — Script Connection  
  Load your daily-summary-mentee.js file at the bottom of the page.  
  This ensures all HTML elements are loaded before JavaScript tries to access them.  
  All variable creation, updates, summary building, and display logic will run here. -->
