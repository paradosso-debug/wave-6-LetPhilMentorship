# Project-03 — Loops

## Study Session Loop Tracker

This project practices **loops** while reusing everything learned so far:

- variables
- data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- operators (+, -, /, +=)
- conditionals (if / else if / else)
- DOM selection and events

## Idea

The user enters:

- how many study sessions they did (`sessions`)
- how many minutes each session lasted (`minutesPerSession`)

Your code:

1. Uses a **for loop** to simulate each session.
2. Keeps a running total of all minutes.
3. Builds a multi-line summary (one line per session).
4. Uses **conditionals** to give feedback:
   - Light study day
   - Solid study day
   - Intense study day

The summary is displayed inside a `<pre>` so line breaks are preserved.
