    Project-02 — Daily Expense Checker 

    Goal:
      Build a small page where the user can:
        1) Type how much money they PLANNED to spend today.
        2) Type how much money they ACTUALLY spent.
        3) Click a button.
        4) See a message telling them if they stayed under budget,
           went a little over, or went over by a lot.

    STEP 1 — Create an <h1> with text: Daily Expense Checker
    STEP 2 — Create an <input> type="number" id="planned" placeholder="Planned amount"
    STEP 3 — Create an <input> type="number" id="actual" placeholder="Actual amount"
    STEP 4 — Create a <button> with id="checkBtn" and text: Check Budget
    STEP 5 — Create an <h2> with text: Result:
    STEP 6 — Create a <p> with id="result"
    STEP 7 — Add <script src="project-02-operators-mentee.js"></script> at the bottom
  --></body>
