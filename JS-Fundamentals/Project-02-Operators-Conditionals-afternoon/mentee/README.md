# Project 02 — Operators & Conditionals

## 🌱 Overview
Practice doing math with operators and guiding program flow with conditional logic.

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Compute with `+ - * /` and rounding.
- Compare values and use strict equality `===`.
- Combine conditions using `&&` and `||`.
- Write readable `if / else if / else` chains.

## 🌍 Real-Life Relevance
- **Math:** totals, discounts, time calculations.
- **Comparisons:** age checks, inventory thresholds.
- **Equality:** verifying codes, matching IDs.
- **Logic:** role permissions, feature flags.
- **Conditionals:** branching UI, validation messages.

## 📁 What’s Inside
Each topic file contains **5 mini-examples (EX1–EX5)** to practice.
Mini-project: **Simple Calculator**.

## ✅ Checklist
- [ ] I can use all basic arithmetic operators.
- [ ] I prefer `===` for equality checks.
- [ ] I can combine conditions with `&&` and `||`.
- [ ] I can write a clear conditional chain.
