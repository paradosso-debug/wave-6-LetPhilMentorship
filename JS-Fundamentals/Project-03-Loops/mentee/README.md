# Project 03 — Loops

## 🌱 Overview

Loops let us repeat actions without writing the same code again and again. You’ll practice five common loop patterns and learn when to use each.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Write `for` and `while` loops safely (avoid infinite loops).
- Iterate over arrays with `for...of`.
- Control loop flow using `break` and `continue`.
- Understand nested loops for grid-like data.

## 🌍 Real-Life Relevance

| Concept          | Everyday Analogy            | Real-World Example                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| For loop         | Counting seats row by row   | Rendering a list of products on a page           |
| While loop       | “Keep stirring until thick” | Polling until an API is ready                    |
| For...of         | Go through items in a box   | Check each playlist song title                   |
| Break / Continue | Skip or stop                | Stop on the first match; skip out-of-stock items |
| Nested loops     | Table inside a table        | Building a weekly schedule (days × time slots)   |

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] I can write `for` and `while` loops with correct start/stop conditions.
- [ ] I can iterate through arrays using `for...of`.
- [ ] I can use `break` to stop and `continue` to skip.
- [ ] I can write simple nested loops to build 2D outputs.
