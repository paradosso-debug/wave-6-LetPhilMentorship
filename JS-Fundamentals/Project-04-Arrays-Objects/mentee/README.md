# Project 04 — Arrays & Objects

## 🌱 Overview

Arrays store ordered lists of values, and objects store labeled properties. Together, they model nearly all data in everyday apps.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Create and read arrays (`[]`) and objects (`{}`).
- Add, remove, and search values with common array methods.
- Loop through arrays safely and clearly.
- Build and access **arrays of objects** for real-world modeling.

## 🌍 Real-Life Relevance

| Concept           | Everyday Analogy           | Real-World Example                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Arrays            | A to‑do list               | Shopping cart items in order                |
| Objects           | A contact card with fields | User profile `{ name, email, role }`        |
| Array methods     | Tools in a toolbox         | Add/remove items, check if a product exists |
| Iteration         | Checking items one by one  | Render each product on a page               |
| Arrays of objects | Spreadsheet rows           | Product list, students list, API results    |

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] I can create arrays/objects and read values.
- [ ] I can add/remove items with push/pop/shift/unshift.
- [ ] I can search arrays with `includes` / `indexOf`.
- [ ] I can loop an array with `for`, `for...of`, or `forEach`.
- [ ] I can model data as an **array of objects** and access nested fields.
